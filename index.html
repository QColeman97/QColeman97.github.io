    <h1>Welcome to Quinn Coleman's Website</h1>
    <p>
        I am a software engineer with a background in software quality assurance and test automation. I have 4 years of experience programming in Python, which includes my master's thesis project in machine learning. In my free time, I like to play the trumpet or get outdoors.
